  "The Middle to Upper Paleozoic rock sequences show the lacunary development, which is known from the vast areas in north, southwest, and central Iran. At first sight, it can be ascribed to block-faulting in response to the crustal disturbances caused by Caledonian and Hercynian movements with epirogenic characters, which coincide with the Paleozoic orogenies in Eurasia. The movement and block-faulting led to the formation of intracratonic horst and subsiding grabens in the Paleozoic platform with a complex, mosaic-like pattern. Inherited structural features and lineaments from the Baikalian basement have controlled sedimentation patterns from the Silurian up to the Permian. Reactivation of these basement faults led to swelling and formation of shallow marine environments, and therefore the Vendian-Ordovician platform was divided into several fragments. Block faulting was responsible for regional sedimentation gaps in the Silurian-Permian sequences and facies variations from one block to another.",
  "Regional distribution of Silurian to Middle Devonian rocks is limited to a vast part of Central Iran and eastern Alborz, including southern Kope Dagh, where carbonate-clastic sediments and volcanic rocks are the dominant lithologies. Apart from these the following two isolated exposures should be noted: Lower to Middle Devonian and Silurian rocks have been reported from southwest Caspian Range (Davis et al. 1975) while lower to Middle Devonian rocks have been described from south of Aras River, northern Azerbaijan in Iran (Alavi and Blourchi, 1970).",
  "For the rest of the Paleozoic platform (Silurian to Early Devonian) there was a great gap in sedimentation. ",
