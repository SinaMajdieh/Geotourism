  "The geological information of Iran up to mid of the 20th century was not well known. Limited and scattered information on the geology of Iran was only available reports which were given by European tourists and based on those reports, and some geological concepts were introduced. The geology of Central and East Iran were not included in those reports, and some of those concepts were accepted as absolute facts but were subsequently revised into more modern structural interpretations (Stahl, 1911, Boeckh et al., 1929, Gansser, 1955, Khain, Bagedanoff, 1964). Systematic mapping of various parts of Iran in the last half-century, which was carried out by the Geological Survey of Iran and the National Iranian Oil Company, has revealed many fundamental facts. It has been shown that structural complexity of the Iranian mountain ranges and development of the sedimentary basins have certain peculiarities which are too difficult to explain according to conventional geosynclinals theory of mountain building. Numerous published papers indicate that Iranian mountain ranges are greatly developed due to Alpine Orogeny. However, the new structural information obtained in recent years has strengthened an idea of greater structural mobility on the basis of new concepts of plate tectonics. Applying the concept of plate tectonics and revision of previous interpretation leads to the recognition of differentiation of more structural zones and sedimentary basin developments (Eftekharnezhad 1980,1982,1991).",
  "In the following discussion, the structural evolution of Iran will be briefly presented with special emphasis on the continental drift in relation to distinct ophiolite zones and specific characteristics of the proposed zones.",
