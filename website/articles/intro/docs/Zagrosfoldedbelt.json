 "content": [
  "The southwestern marginal part of the Paleozoic platform has been separated from the rest of Iran from Late Triassic as a steadily subsiding trough. It is filled with a continuous sequence of marine to shelf-facies sediments with a thickness of several thousands of meters (around 14 km), ranging in age from early Mesozoic to Neogene.",
  "The Zagros belt has been folded during the latest phase of the Alpine orogeny from the Miocene to Recent time; the sediments have been folded into a series of oil trap anticlines and synclines of regional extent including northeastern part of Iraq.",
