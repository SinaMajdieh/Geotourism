  "Cretaceous tensile stresses which had affected central Iran and resulted in developing the initial deep fracture separated the continental landmass into several blocks and created a narrow Red Sea Type oceanic trough, in which submarine rift volcanics, mainly pelagic and some neritic sediments were deposited. Ophiolitic rocks appeared in their axial parts, in narrow ring shape surrounding central Iranian",
  "Micro-Continent (Inner Axial Ophiolitic belt, Stocklin 1977). Another ophiolitic sub-belt which shows all characteristic of Inner ophiolitic sub-belt lies northeast of Zagros thrust. Extending from inner Anatolia to Turkey to the Iranian border, and continues southeast to Sanandaj area where it gets the same direction of Outer ophiolitic sub-belt along the Main Zagros Thrust (Stocklin, 1977) and extends to Southeast of Herein.",
