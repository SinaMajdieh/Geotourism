  "As explained in the previous paragraph, the entire Vendian to Upper Permian and Lower to Middle Triassic entire Iran remained tectonically calm and stable with a platform sedimentary characteristic. All exposed features indicate epirogenic character, and there is no significant folding, deformation, and magmatic activities. An important tectonic event of Early Cimmerian (Late Triassic) is marked by splitting of the Permian- early Triassic platform resulting in a bifurcating into separate facies zones and sedimentary basins. Due to regional emergence and subsidence, a drastic change from marine to the continental environment can be distinguished as follows:"
