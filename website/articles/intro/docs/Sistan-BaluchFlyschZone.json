 "title": "Sistan-Baluch Flysch Zone ",
 "content": [
  "The Inner Axial Ophiolitic belt continues with no interruption as a broad flysch zone extending eastwards from the Iranian to the Pakistanian Makran. The ophiolitic oceanic basement buried below the thick flysch masses in the Makran-Baluchestan region and reappeared along with a series of longitudinal faults. Tertiary flysch continues from the Makran as a narrow zone between Central Iranian Lut Block and Heldman or Afghan block of the\" Sistan Ocean.\"",
  "Makran and East Iran flysch would seem to establish the Cenozoic Subduction zone and accretionary prism. In the Markan, the Cenozoic flysch ranges in age from late Paleocene through Eocene, Oligocene to Early Miocene in the southern flysch zone. The immensely thick flysch sequences were then abruptly succeeded by quite thick neritic sequences of Middle to Late Miocene and Early Pliocene age.",
  "Before closing, the Sistan Ocean in the east was filled with an immense thickness of abyssal turbidities in Eocene.",
