  "The Zagros through in the northeast appears as a narrow thrusting zone, which was formerly regarded as the deepest part of the Zagros geosyncline. Based on the latest interpretation, during upper Triassic due to extensional movement a significant fracture originated along with the present Zagros thrust, and following the widening of this fracture, a new oceanic crust created in the southeastern part of the Zagros crushed zone, and later on, abyssal, radiolarian sediments were deposited in this established oceanic crust. This concept also was suggested by Glennee et al. (1973), who believe that the Zagros-Oman trough resulted from continental breakup and subsequent spreading from SUCH a ridge. The oceanic trough or Mesotethys in Oman began to form in the upper Triassic-Cretaceous time progressively from SE to NW. This oceanic lithosphere, which represents the intercontinental structure zone of southeast Zagros was consumed in the early Cretaceous due to subduction, and the Zagros was joined again to Central Iran leaving a narrow strip of a chaotic mixture of various rocks including ophiolite, sedimentary and metamorphic components all of which are highly contorted and crushed. This assemblage is known as the\"Ophiolitic  Melange.\" On the bases of plate tectonics and ocean-floor spreading concept, the ophiolitic assemblage is regarded as a fragment of oceanic crust and upper mantle emplaced in an orogenic belt (Dewey and Bird 1971). It is identified by the Outer Axial Ophiolitic belt (Stockline, 1977). This process took place in Cretaceous time and was completed before the Maestrichtian, and shallow-water Limestones of Trabur Formation overlaps the Colored m√©lange complex transgressively in the Neyriz area."
