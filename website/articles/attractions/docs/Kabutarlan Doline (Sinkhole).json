  "Kabutarlan doline is one of the eye-catching phenomena in Ilam Province. This doline with the diameter of 80m and depth of 15m has a surface near 500m-2. Kabutarlan doline has formed in the gypsum- bearing (gypsiferous) calcareous-dolomitic formation of Gachsaran (Miocene). Numerous birds, particularly wild pigeons live in this doline, which flee away when approached by human beings; that’s why people have given it the name “Kabutarlan,” meaning “nest of pigeons.”   ",
