  "The vast plain of Lut exhibits unique landscapes of desert phenomena. Rood Shoor river flows down from hundreds of kilometers away into Lut plain where it disappears. Along the edges of this river, eye- catching phenomena can be seen: the crystals of salt gypsum, and Anhydride in various forms, salt pans and hexagons, vast clay plains with their unique form, like a mud land across which the beasts have trodden (passed). Also, Gandom Beryan basalt plateau which has formed by the ﬂows from the crater of a young volcano is one of Lut scenic landscapes.",
