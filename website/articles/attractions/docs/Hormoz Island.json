  "Hormoz Island is itself a salt dome, which has peeled out of the waters in Hormoz strait. Apart from its very scenic biological landscapes, Hormoz island has wonderful geological aspects too. The Hormoz’s geological landscapes are formed by collections of various stones and ores outcropped from Hormoz salt dome. The variety of Earth-related colors throughout the island has turned every corner of the island into a picturesque painting of thousands of colors. The oligist, hematite, gypsum, halite, pyrite ores abound on this island. The red soil of this island is among the world’s best. Hormoz Island is a paradise for the mineralogists and researchers in the field of salt domes.    "
