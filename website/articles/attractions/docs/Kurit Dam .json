  "Kurit dam which its formation goes back to 500 years ago is a masterpiece of architecture and location operation by the ancient Iranians. Some researchers attribute it to the Sassanid or even Achaemanid periods. This dam is located in Shotory Mountains at the mouth of a valley near the village of Kurit at the 65 km distance from Tabas city. Even today, the new dam of Kurit has been built in the same location. The height of the dam is 50m long, its crown is 55m long and surprisingly its width is just a little more than 1m. The arch-shaped dam of Kurit has been made of materials such as stone and brick, and Saroj mortar. This dam had even been equipped with the water regulation and dewatering tower. From the point of view of geotectonics, the location of this dam has been a valuable job.  ",
