  "Kabirkooh is the most significant and biggest mountain chain in Ilam province, which is in alignment with the Zagros mountain range(northwest-southeast) and is, in fact, part of it. The length of this mountain chain is about 16Okm, and its highest altitude reaches to nearly 3000m.  Kabirkooh is a huge anticline in Sarvak Formation (Upper Cretaceous). Many transverse valleys and water gaps are seen on both sides of this mountain, some of these valleys are deep and narrow, while others are wide and shallow. A spectacular phenomenon on the way from Ilam to Darre Shahr is a narrow fissure that is nearly 5m deep and more than 1000 m long, lying along the road. The walls of this fissure are heterogeneously sheared having a rough outcrop. It seems that erosion by flowing waters have created such a fissure.  "
