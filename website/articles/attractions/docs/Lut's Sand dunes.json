  "ln the 1000Okm area of Riggé Yalan in the east of Lut desert, some rare phenomena can be seen. These phenomena have included the various structures of eolian sands. In this vast area, a treasure of forms and eolian-sand structures catch the eyes. Lut sand pyramids that are sand hills with the height of near 500m are among the highest and biggest of world’s sand pyramids. In the vicinity of Nosrat Abad, one can find good paths to access these sands; near Karim Abad also the arch-shaped forms of sand hills (Barchan) can be seen. Traversing across the Lut eolian sands is a difficult job, what some adventure tourists of nature have recently got an interest in.  "
