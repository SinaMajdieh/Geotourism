  "The beautiful village of Uraman or Horaman Takht is located in the south-east of Marivan city. This historical village has been built on a very steep slope in a step-like pattern. In this village, the houses are mostly built of stones. Uraman Takht village stands on the east side of a green valley facing the 2800m mountain of Takht. This village is bigger than the famous village of Masool' in Gillan Province and is, therefore, named as 'Hezar Masool'' (Thousands of Masool'). It is worth to be mentioned that though there are many such villages in the provinces of Kermanshah and Kurdestan that are not so well-known and talked of, they have matchless and scenic beauties. This village's being located on a steep slope, and the steadiness of its houses has given it a significant value in Engineering Geology and Geotechnics."
