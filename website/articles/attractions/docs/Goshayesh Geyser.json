  "At the 15-km distance of the south-east Maraqé, there lies a valley named “Goshayesh.” After a little while of walking through this valley, one can see some springs where C02 and water gush out. The gas has turned the water in some springs white. The gush of water in some springs is accompanied with a lot of noise. On the laps of the heights surrounding the valley, the remnants of travertine springs can be seen. The fresh travertine deposits in light colors can be seen too. In addition to geysers, this valley has eye-catching natural landscapes as well.",
