  "Damavand, lran’s national emblem, is the Middle East’s highest mountain and probably the world’s biggest inter-continental volcano (according to Dr. Jamshid Hasanzadé). Damavand, at the altitude of 5620m, is a quaternary volcano. The traces of different phases of its activities can be found in its surrounding lava spreading over an area of 400 km? Damavand holds the various examples of volcanic phenomena: columnar Basalt, lava ?ows, Lapilli, bomb, ashes, and hot mineral springs as well as fumes coming out of its crater. Damavand is the first site registered in the list of lran’s Natural Heritage. Permanent glaciers, surrounding deep valleys, the landscape of Lar plain and Lake behind Lar Dam are among Damavand’s eye-catching beauties. There has been a mention of Damavand in the poems and written pieces of poets, writers, historians, and tourists, old and modern. Damavand has always been one of the unique international attractions in lran’s tourism, and also it has high potentiality for geotourism."
