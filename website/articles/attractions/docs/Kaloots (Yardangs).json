  "Kaloots in the Lut desert covering an area as big as 80 in 120km are one of the biggest Kaloot regions in the world. In this 1O, OO0km2 area, a series of deep and parallel furrows(grooves) along the northwest-southeast trend have formed in the lake deposits. These furrows have made high walls along their course called Kaloot. Kaloots are seen in the west part of Lut. Erosion is the main cause of the formation of Kaloots, though some researchers have also considered the role of tectonics in their formation. Kaloots of Lut desert are the highest Yardangs in the world. Sometimes the height of these Kaloots reaches over 100m. In some Kaloots, from Shahdad to Dehsalam near the road, erosion has created sceneries which look like a desolated town from afar. Forms like ruined houses and forts and castles torn to the ground amid the Kaloots catch the eyes. This part of the Lut desert is called Lut city, a fictional town."
