  "The lovely village of Dashtak, a community amid the prominent anticline of Dashtak, is situated in the northwest of Shiraz. Dashtak anticline, like Zagros’ other anticline, stands along with the northwest-southeast trend. It has formed in the formations of Sarvak and Kajdomi (cretaceous). Dashtak village has a texture similar to the well-known village of Masoolé in Gilan province. The houses in this village have been built in a step-like pattern following the natural slope of the land. It is a historical village at the altitude of 200m on a vast high plain. The numerous big walnut trees surrounding this village and beautiful waterfalls have created a lovely landscape in this region.",
