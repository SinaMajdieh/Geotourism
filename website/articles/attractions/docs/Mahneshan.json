  "In the sandstone and conglomeratic formation in the areas surrounding Mahneshan in Zanjan province, one can find scenic types of erosion phenomena such as chimney rocks, earth pillar, and hoodoo. These interesting forms have come to existence due to some of the erodible formations being saved and sheltered under a cap of harder one. People in their local tongue call this phenomenon “Adam Dashi,” meaning “Adam’s rock”; the unique shapes of these phenomena have given them such a name. Such phenomena are seen almost everywhere in Iran, but in Mahneshan, one can find a broader diversity in the numerous erosion phenomena. Mahneshan chimney rocks are in the Pliocene formations."
