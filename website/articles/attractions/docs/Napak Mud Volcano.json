 "content": [
  "Napak Mud volcano in local language means the Earthâ€™s Navel. Due to its high activity and large size, this mud volcano is the most familiar in Sistan and Baluchestan. The mam sediments coming out of this mud volcano has created a hill 25m high. Apart from the main active (dynamic) crater above the hill, there are other craters around it, of which some are active and some extinct. The mudflows running down the hill are so scenic as volcanic flows. The mud flowing down this mud volcanic has high viscosity.    "
