 "content": [
  "In the north of Eshtehard, the syncline and anticline of “Halqédar” have made beautiful landscapes. These phenomena are located in the upper Sorkh formations (Miocene-Pliocene) in colorful strip-like features with the west-east trend. This formation has exposed conglomerate (slag), marl, gypsum, and sandstone in red, pink, brown, and white. The river Shoor passes through these heights, and a few salt pits are operating in this region.  ",
