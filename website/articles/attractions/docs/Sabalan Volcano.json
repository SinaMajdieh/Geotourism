  "Sabalan, at the altitude of 4815m, is regarded as a legendary volcano in Iran, mainly to Azary people. This quaternary volcano includes three summits of Sultan, Heram, and Kasra, of which the Sultan is the loftiest. The natural landscapes surrounding this inactive volcano are so rarely beautiful. A few glacial tongues around this summit, a crater lake at its highest point, a variety of Lava, and numerous hot springs on foothills are among the phenomena belonging to this inactive volcano. Sabalan’s big Calera (the old collapsed crater) with a diameter reaching 20 km and the collapse of 400m (Babakhani,1987) is a rare geological phenomenon. The domestic and foreign tourists widely use the hot mineral springs in the north and south of Sabalan, particularly in Sar-Eyn, which is itself a tourist pole in the whole province. Iran hottest mineral spring with a temperature of about 86 °C and the first geothermal Energy Centre in the country is located in the north-west part of this volcano.",
