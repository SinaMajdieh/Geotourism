 "content": [
  "In a major area of the 54000 km2 desert of Lut, there is no trace of life. Only in the surroundings of this vast desert are there some signs of life of which the Nebkhas or desert flowerpots are the most important ones; the little hills which hold in the middle a plant such as Gaz (Tamarisk)  or Taq all embraced by masses of windblown sands. These small hemisphere-like hills play an essential role in keeping the villages and roads against shifting sands movements. Nebkhas in the Lut desert are huge, and some researchers believe these Nebkhas are the biggest in the world. Widespread and strip-like Nebkhas can be seen in the south of Lut near Karim Abad, whose length reaches to 30m and height mounts to 10m. Rebdos are the Nebkhas larger type. ",
