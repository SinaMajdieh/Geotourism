  "Karoon river, the most affluent and longest river in Iran, has made beautiful phenomena all along its course. Shearing and eroding the formations by the river is one of such a series of phenomena. In the upstream part of Karoon I dam (Shahid Abbaspoor dam) and Paleogene Limestones, such erosions are eye-catching and scenic. Boating in the narrow water channels behind the clam while looking up at the beautiful high walls is so attractive."
