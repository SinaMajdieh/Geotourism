 "content": [
  "Sahand volcano has created the most extensive spread of alternation of cinder and lava in Iran(45OO km2). This volcano has numerous cinder cones, some of which also have crater lakes. Two little and short yet sightly cones of Sahand are located in the Bostan Abad region: Chenaq Daqi and Almalogol. Ch√©naq Daqi cone is one with a short shield-like cone which is easily accessible by 4WD cars. The morphology of this cinder cone and its surrounding radial waterways characterize it as one of the most spectacular cinder cones of Sahand. Almalogol cinder cone is in the vicinity of Chenaq Daqi. It is mostly characterized by the water being gathered in its crater to form a seasonal lake that has an exceptional beauty itself. The locals are engaged in agriculture and animal husbandry within this crater. These two craters are explosion crater types.",
