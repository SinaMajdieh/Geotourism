  "The wonderful valley of Shirez is located at the 30km distance of the east of Koohdasht town in Lorestan. In this valley, one can find very rare and sometimes matchless natural and geological sceneries. This valley is a breccia in the large Halilan anticline. The Asmari, Shahbazan, and Talle Zang formations (Eocene-Oligocene) have their outcrops in this location. Seymar√© river passing through the valley has given it a unique state of greenery and verdancy. The high lime walls in cream and buff have mounted on the sides of the valley in which the joints, fractures, and erosion have made beautiful phenomena. The narrow vales reaching the main valley are also so wet all covered by the trees and plants. Shirez vale is an intact region with a high potentiality for the development of geotourism and ecotourism.    "
