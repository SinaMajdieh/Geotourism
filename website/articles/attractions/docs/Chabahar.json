  "The erodible formations of Clay and Marn surrounding the city of Chabahar have been eroded by the heavy seasonal rains creating attractive erosion forms. These forms sometimes appear in the form of parallel stream ways, branching stream ways, hummocky dune-bedded masses. The variety of colors and unique erosion forms have created attractive sceneries in this region. The green, gray, white tertiary Marns have made the formations of this region.",
