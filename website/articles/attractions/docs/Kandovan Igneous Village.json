  "One of the wonderful phenomena in the west lap of Sahand volcano is the ancient village of Kandovan. in this village, cave-like homes are seen, all dug by hand in the layers of lahar and ignimbrite. These houses are all quipped by water, and sewage pipes, as well as electrical power and people, use such facilities as in other houses to live. This handmade Kandovan different from its bigger counterpart in Turkey, Cappadocia (Kapadokia), giving it a unique feature. The lahar deposits in Kandovan valley, due to the erosion worked by flowing waters have turned to form the cones named Karan in the local language. Each Karan holds one house, which can be on two or sometimes on three floors. A characteristic of Karans is the difference in their inside and outside temperature. In winters, Karans are warmer than outside, while in summers, they are cooler than outside."
