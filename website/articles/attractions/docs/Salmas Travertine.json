  "In the vicinity of Salmas city, somewhere called Darik, one can see the travertine deposits and the remnants(traces) left out travertine springs. Here a few active springs also exist. The stairway-like milky deposits, cone- and shield-like forms, and colorful deposits are among the scenic sites in this region. Here, the springs have formed along the faults, and the widespread travertine veins can be seen along with these faults.    ",
