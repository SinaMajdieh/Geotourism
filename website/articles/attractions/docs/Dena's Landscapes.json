  "The Dena mountain chain has a tend running to about 70km and has dozens of high peaks. The heights of Dena have formed in a part of over trusted Zagros and folded Zagros. A diversity of anticlines, including the grand anticline of Dena, have their own outcrops in this area. The north landscape of this mountain (from Esfahan's side) varies significantly from its southern one (from Kohkiluye Buyer Ahmad's side). The lush coverage of oak trees in the south and its high snow-covered edges have given it the name \"Iran's Alp.\" In one of the deep breccias (in the form of a gorge in the north-west of the southern wall) near Ab Sepah village, one can see a fairly thorough history of Zaygon to Darian formations (Cambrian to Cretaceous)."
