 "content": [
  "In the vicinity of Makoo city, there lies a vastness of Hexagon Basalt Columns. Such columns have formed as the result of tensile forces when the lava solidiÔ¨Åed, and they are perpendicular to the solidified surface. These columns are located along a valley; they are 50 m high and have open splits among them. Makoo basalts are the result of the last phase of igneous events in Iran in the Quaternary period. ",
