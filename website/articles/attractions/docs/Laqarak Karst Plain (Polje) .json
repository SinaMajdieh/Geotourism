 "content": [
  "The karst plain of Laqarak (Polje) in the Koohrang region of Chahar Mahalé Bakhtiary province is near the town of Baba Heydar. This high plain is one of the rare examples of such phenomena at the altitude of 2700m. This vast plain that has the area of 9 km2 is located amid the Cretaceous limy heights near Koohrang number 3 tunnel. The waters flowing from the surrounding heights pour onto the plain and run down through the karst holes (ponor) into the ground to appear as springs in the vicinity of Baba Heydar. Due to making a special sound when running down into the holes, these waters have been given the name “Qor Qoru” by the locals. Laqarak plain is so lush in springtime having so many beautiful natural sceneries.",
