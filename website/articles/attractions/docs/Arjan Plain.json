 "content": [
  "The plain of Arjan is a karst plain (Polje). This plain is a graben between the faults of Kazeroon and Arjan. The plain slope is eastward, and the water collected in it flows down toward the Parishan lake with the help of ponors. Along the margins of this plain, the lofty Jahrom and Asmary formations are visible. Numerous karst springs have appeared by the faulting surface of this graben. The abundance of water has created unique natural landscapes in this plain.",
